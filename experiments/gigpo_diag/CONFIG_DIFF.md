# appworld: reference recipe and execution differences

Reference: `examples/gigpo_trainer/run_appworld.sh`, upstream commit in SOURCE.json. This run follows the locked source recipe, not an exact reproduction of a historical paper table.

- Initialization: Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct + tokenizer revision `989aa7980e4cf806f80c7fef2b1adb7bc71aa306`. Immutable named directory; full file hashes checked before loading. No old pilot/RL checkpoint, no SFT.
- Preserve train batch 16, group 8, val batch 16, native prompt/parser/history, native reward and invalid penalty 0.1, KL loss 0.01, learning rate 1e-6, gamma .95, step weight 1, native normalization, 150 epochs. Dynamic filtering disabled; exact anchors.
- Resource adaptation: 2 Slurm GPUs, TP from reference; actor and logprob microbatch 2. No hardcoded CUDA devices. Separate Python 3.12.5 venv; vLLM version from each source recipe, pinned dependencies in requirements-runtime.txt.
- Native checkpoint every 10 updates and at native final boundary; keep all native saved checkpoints, including optimizer/extra/tokenizer. Initial model is a pinned reference. A walltime interruption may lose work since the latest complete checkpoint; no claim of automatic final checkpoint on SIGKILL.
- Initial eval enabled, native eval every 5 updates. Native ALF/Sci holdout evaluated in aggregate; full holdout text excluded. Fixed train/dev study slices and prefix probes are not yet implemented and do not block native training.
- SwanLab uses the existing Tracking owner once; local process-sharded JSONL always saved. Failed network logging is nonfatal. Raw trace/model artifacts are not uploaded to GitHub or tracker.
- Diagnostics detached/read-only; explicit step identity before reordering. Native invalid penalty is captured before/after mutation; actual AE/AS/joint captured within each native core. Original sampled tokens remain the loss target. Local parameter samples and successful native weight-loading calls are logged separately from driver update count.
- ScienceWorld-only: parent samples original L0 pool with replacement, repeats explicit task/variation/reset seed, worker loads it; same task/observation/state-summary verified before training. Python sampler state has a checkpoint sidecar. Original easy preset and reference `10 * (done and score>0)` retained; no score-delta/milestone shaping. Strict uses Java completion and unrounded score>=1 only as a diagnostic. Two groups x two live resets precede training.
- AppWorld-only: native one-response code turn, train/dev split, max_interactions aligned to max_steps. `multi_episode_rollout=False`, success_coef=0 and prompt_type=vanilla; the latter two are not read by the AppWorld ordinary prompt/reward path (ALF/WebShop shaping is a separate branch). No claim that AppWorld's previous default success_coef caused shaping. 16*8 + 16*1 = 144 services derived from resolved config. Unique job/worker/reset experiments preserve native API traces. No global process cleanup. AppWorld library pinned to upstream Git commit 42b5bcf3cd334fee33f0c37c02070a9f5807add5 per Git-install recipe (PyPI 0.1.3.post1 requires pydantic1 and conflicts with vLLM).

Native schedules and environment RNG may not resume bitwise identically (ALFWorld/TextWorld and AppWorld worker state not checkpointed). ScienceWorld task sampler sidecar restores its newly introduced independent RNG. Unknown labels remain null. No actual training has run locally; only HPC results can establish updates or learning.

## Installation repair after first HPC attempt (2026-10-13)

Observed: ALFWorld job 160221 built/installed flash-attn, then pip rejected
`ray[default]` in the constraints file. AppWorld job 160225 failed resolution:
vLLM 0.8.5 requires OpenTelemetry SDK 1.26.x but Ray[default] 2.49.0 requires >=1.30.
ScienceWorld job 160223 received an unknown Content-Type for the datasets index;
the same datasets 3.6.0 was found in the other jobs. Module pip/setuptools also
leaked from /apps/spack into the activated venv in all logs.

Separate constraints-runtime.txt strips extras; requirements-runtime.txt retains
the requested extras. Clear module PYTHONPATH/PYTHONHOME in both setup and train,
invoke installation using the absolute venv Python with -I, and verify imported
pip + distribution metadata reside in that venv. Retry only recognized transient
transport/index errors, at most three attempts. Each project gets its own pip cache.
Existing venvs and installed flash-attn are reused. No directory/cache purge or
global pip installation. Training recipe, model, reward and algorithm are unchanged.

AppWorld dependency adaptation: Ray[default] 2.47.1 permits SDK 1.26.x and meets
vLLM's >=2.43,!=2.44.* requirement. SwanLab 0.7.0 accepts protobuf 4.x, required by
OpenTelemetry proto 1.26.0; SwanLab 0.10.2 instead requires protobuf >=6.31.1.
Keep vLLM 0.8.5 and torch 2.6.0. This is a declared runtime dependency adaptation,
not an exact recreation of the source README's Ray 2.49.0 installation sequence.
